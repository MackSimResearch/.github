# MackSim

In MackSim Research Group, we investigate the properties of nanoscale materials, mainly (2D) two-dimensional materials. A wide variety of properties are explored in this research group, including electronic, structural, mechanical, magnetic, optical and electrochemical properties. We also work in human resources training, forming academic researchers from undergraduate to graduate students.
